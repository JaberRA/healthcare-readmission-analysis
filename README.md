# Healthcare Readmission Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
Hospital readmissions within 30 days are a major quality and cost concern in healthcare systems. This project analyzes patient-level healthcare data to identify patterns and risk factors associated with hospital readmissions. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making that can help reduce avoidable readmissions and improve patient outcomes.

## Objectives
- Analyze hospital readmission trends using structured healthcare data  
- Identify high-risk patient groups based on demographic and clinical factors  
- Perform SQL-based analysis to answer operational healthcare questions  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis using R  
- Present findings through clear and meaningful visualizations  

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL-style syntax)
- R (tidyverse, ggplot2)
- Excel (data validation and preprocessing)
- GitHub (version control and documentation)
